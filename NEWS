Changes in version 1.3.3
+ tximeta now also caches the transcript ranges themselves,
  rather than just the TxDb. This shaves extra seconds off
  the tximeta() call!

Changes in version 1.3.1
+ add 'skipSeqinfo' argument, which avoids attempting
  to fetch chromosome information (from UCSC) if set
  to TRUE.

Changes in version 1.1.18
+ Specifying gene=TRUE in addIds() when rows are
  transcripts will attempt to use a gene_id column
  to map the IDs. This usually gives a better mapping
  rate.

Changes in version 1.1.14
+ Cut off version number from Ensembl names only (not Gencode)

Changes in version 1.1.13
+ Added 'cleanDuplicateTxps' argument, which does a lot of work
  for the user: it downloads the FASTA from the source, identifies
  duplicate transcripts (identical cDNA sequence) then looks to
  see if transcripts that are in the quantification files,
  but missing from the GTF, could be renamed from the list of
  duplicate transcripts such that they would be present in the GTF.

Changes in version 1.1.11
+ Added coding + non-coding combinations of Ensembl transcriptomes
  to the hash table. Must be in this order: coding, then non-coding.

Changes in version 1.1.9
+ Added support for dammit de novo transcriptomes.

Changes in version 1.1.6
+ Added summarizeToGene as a method, to avoid conflicts with tximport.

Changes in version 1.1.5
+ Added in Charlotte's code to split out Gencode and Ensembl code
  for generating transcript ranges.
