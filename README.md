## tximeta: Transcript quantification import with rich metadata

# Idea in diagrams

Current versions of Salmon and Sailfish propogate a *signature* of the
transcriptome sequence into the index and quantification
directories. This can be diagrammed like so, where the dotted lines
represent not direct links, but possible comparisons that could be
made based on signature. The signature is a SHA256 hash of the
transcriptome cDNA sequence, excluding transcript identifiers
(this may change going forward, to enable coordination with
larger efforts at data-driven identifiers for collections of
sequences, see the last section of vignette for details).

Following quantification, and even performed by a different analyst or
at a different institute, when importing quantifications into
R/Bioconductor, `tximeta` checks a local database of known
transcriptome signatures, and upon finding a match, automatically adds
annotation and metadata to the quantifications, returning a
`SummarizedExperiment` object. Examples of metadata include transcript
locations, transcript and genome source and version, appropriate
chromosome lengths, etc. This ensures computational reproducibility by
attaching critical annotation information to the data object, such
that exact quantifications can be reproduced from raw data (all
software versions are also attached to the data object).

# Idea in text

`tximeta` performs numerous annotation and metadata gathering tasks on
behalf of users during the import of transcript quantifications from
Salmon or Sailfish into R/Bioconductor. The goal is to provide
something similar to the experience of `GEOquery`, which downloaded
microarray expression data from NCBI GEO and simultaneously brought
along associated pieces of metadata. Doing this automatically helps to
prevent costly bioinformatic errors. To use `tximeta`, all one needs
is the `quant` directory output from Salmon or Sailfish. 

The key idea within `tximeta` is to store a *signature* of
the transcriptome sequence itself using the SHA256 hash, computed and
stored by the `index` and `quant` functions of Salmon and
Sailfish. This signature acts as the identifying information for later
building out rich annotations and metadata in the background, on
behalf of the user. This should greatly facilitate genomic workflows,
where the user can immediately begin overlapping their transcriptomic
data with other genomic datasets, e.g. epigenetic tracks such as ChIP
or methylation, as the data has been embedded within an organism and
genome context, including the proper genome version. We seek to
reduce wasted time of bioinformatic analysts, prevent costly
bioinformatic mistakes, and promote computational reproducibility by
avoiding situations of annotation and metadata ambiguity, when files
are shared publicly or among collaborators but critical details go
missing.
	
# This package undergoing rapid development

`tximeta` is undergoing rapid development, although the core
functionality is now implemented. The largest changes going forward
will be to link up with larger groups developing APIs for identifying
collections of sequences, to replace `tximeta`'s current mechanism
which involves its own lookup table, stored in the `extdata` directory
of the package. 

In addition, we are very interested in providing solutions for 
*de novo* transcriptomes, whether filtered or combined in a
non-standard way from reference sources, or generated by computational
methods. We recommend to use the *linkedTxome* mechanism, as
demonstrated in the vignette, to provide a stable link between the
transcripts used for quantification and a permanent source of sequence
and metadata.
We hope that for these cases `tximeta` might help to assist in
computational reproducibility of quantification, by encapsulating the
steps need to generate the transcriptome and providing a signature for
checking the sequence is indeed the same.

# Do I have to use R?

Much of the power of `tximeta` leverages the rich data objects,
annotation resources, and genomic range manipulation methods of the
Bioconductor project, which is built on the R programming
environment. However, it is possible to wrap up the relevant `tximeta`
commands into an R script which can be called from command line, using
[Rscript](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/Rscript.html).
This will create a `SummarizedExperiment` object with relevant
metadata, then deconstruct the object and print its contents into
multiple files. A simple example of such a script is: 

```{r}
coldata <- read.csv("coldata.csv")
library(tximeta)
se <- tximeta(coldata)
# write out the assay data
for (a in assayNames(se)) {
  write.csv(assays(se)[[a]], file=paste0(a,".csv"))
}
# write out the genomic ranges to BED file
library(rtracklayer)
export(rowRanges(se), con="rowRanges.bed")
# write out metadata about genomic ranges
write.csv(as.data.frame(seqinfo(se)), file="seqInfo.csv")
# write out metadata about the transcriptome
write.csv(as.data.frame(metadata(se)$txomeInfo), file="txomeInfo.csv")
```

This script could be run with the following command line call:

```
Rscript tximeta.R
```

# Where the transcript databases are stored

`tximeta` makes use of the Bioconductor *TxDb* object, which can be
saved and re-loaded from an `sqlite` file. These are saved in a
specific location using the *BiocFileCache* package. Since these
*TxDb* saved objects (sqlite databases) can be ~100 Mb, we want to
make sure the user is OK with these being saved to a given location. 
Also we want to allow for the situation that multiple users share a
*BiocFileCache* location, such that any *TxDb* objects or
*linkedTxome* information can be shared, reducing unnecessary
downloads or emails asking about the provenance of the transcriptome
for a given set of quantification files.

In order to allow that multiple users can read and write to the
same location, one should set the BiocFileCache directory to
have group write permissions (g+w). For use of *tximeta* across
multiple groups, it is recommended to create a new UNIX group that
encompasses multiple groups and assign the *tximeta* BiocFileCache
location to this new group. 

We use the following logic to specify the location of the
*BiocFileCache* used by `tximeta`:

* If run **non-interactively**, `tximeta` uses a temporary directory.
* If run **interactively**, and a location has not been previously
  saved, the user is prompted if she wants to use (1) the default directory
  or a (2) temporary directory.
    - If (1), then use the default directory, and save this choice.
    - If (2), then use a temporary directory for the rest of this R session,
      and ask again next R session.
* The prompt above also mentions that a specific function can be used to
  manually set the directory at any time point, and this choice is saved.
* The default directory is given by `rappdirs::user_cache_dir("BiocFileCache")`.
* The choice itself of the BiocFileCache directory that `tximeta` should use is
  saved in a JSON file here `rappdirs::user_cache_dir("tximeta")`.

# Take a look at the example

We have a *tximeta* vignette for how `tximeta` would look, and some
thoughts on next steps at the end of the document.
